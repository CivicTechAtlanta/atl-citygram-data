          Hodgepodge Coffeehouse is a bit of a triple threat: It slings killer espresso drinks, provides quiet space crucial for laptopping, and plays host to regular art shows. MISHMASH pays homage to the latter, stitching together a roster of folks who have shown at the cafe in the past. The exhibition features 24 artists in total, meant to span the diverse spectrum of Atlanta’s robust visual arts scene. Ray Geier brings his cartoony cephalopods as sQuishiepuss (see his work above). Catlanta is scheduled to hang work, as is Lindy Lane, Rebecca Payne, and Susannah Leigh Caviness, among others. The espresso bar will be open and baked goods will also be available for purchase. Wouldn’t wanna sleep on absorbing such killer art, right?

          You know who Dolly Parton is. You do not need me to tell you, just like you don’t need me to explain Madonna, Oprah, or Jesus. Some things in life, including upbeat, glass-ceiling-shattering country music icons, are just given. This summer Parton embarks on her Pure & Simple Tour, which coincides with the release of an album of the same name. Like the tour, the double-disc Pure & Simple is filled with Dolly classics and some new tunes. Dolly’s summer dates make up her first major tour in more than two decades. Audiences can expect a scaled-down show with minimal effects and plenty of hits (Yes, “Jolene,” yes, “I Will Always Love You”) to sing along to.

          On those nights when a Manhattan on the rocks satisfies more than an ice-cold beer, the jazzy piano stylings of Anita Aysola go down easy. “Empty Glass” from her debut album, More Than Maybe, slides gently along the ivories as her voice slips over the notes in classic cocktail fashion. She breaks from the mold with “Long Way Home,” a song that blends her Indian heritage and percussion with a classical jazz tinge. It’s a stand-out song and a great nod to two beautiful musical traditions.
