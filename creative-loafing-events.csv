While you enjoy the tattoo contests and celebrate all things ink, grab some barbecue and wash it down with PBR or Sailor Jerry. Feeling lucky?

          Hodgepodge Coffeehouse is a bit of a triple threat: It slings killer espresso drinks, provides quiet space crucial for laptopping, and plays host to regular art shows. MISHMASH pays homage to the latter, stitching together a roster of folks who have shown at the cafe in the past. The exhibition features 24 artists in total, meant to span the diverse spectrum of Atlantaâ€™s robust visual arts scene. Ray Geier brings his cartoony cephalopods as sQuishiepuss (see his work above). Catlanta is scheduled to hang work, as is Lindy Lane, Rebecca Payne, and Susannah Leigh Caviness, among others. The espresso bar will be open and baked goods will also be available for purchase. Wouldnâ€™t wanna sleep on absorbing such killer art, right?

          You know who Dolly Parton is. You do not need me to tell you, just like you donâ€™t need me to explain Madonna, Oprah, or Jesus. Some things in life, including upbeat, glass-ceiling-shattering country music icons, are just given. This summer Parton embarks on her Pure & Simple Tour, which coincides with the release of an album of the same name. Like the tour, the double-disc Pure & Simple is filled with Dolly classics and some new tunes. Dollyâ€™s summer dates make up her first major tour in more than two decades. Audiences can expect a scaled-down show with minimal effects and plenty of hits (Yes, â€œJolene,â€ yes, â€œI Will Always Love Youâ€) to sing along to.

          On those nights when a Manhattan on the rocks satisfies more than an ice-cold beer, the jazzy piano stylings of Anita Aysola go down easy. â€œEmpty Glassâ€ from her debut album, More Than Maybe, slides gently along the ivories as her voice slips over the notes in classic cocktail fashion. She breaks from the mold with â€œLong Way Home,â€ a song that blends her Indian heritage and percussion with a classical jazz tinge. Itâ€™s a stand-out song and a great nod to two beautiful musical traditions.

          The name of this exhibition roughly translates to â€œthe art of life.â€ Fittingly, the works on display will present â€œabstractions inspired by natural forms through drawings, paintings, prints, and sculpture.â€ See the curving and organic sculptures of Mike Goodlett and the Zuzka Vaclavikâ€™s botanical-inspired paintings, among pieces by three other participating artists. The opening reception is Thursday night, and the show will run through June 30 at the Poem 88 space in the Floataway Building (conveniently adjacent to Zonolite Park, a 12-acre forest with footpaths, should you desire a walk with your visit).

          Atlanta Contemporary presents Michi Mekoâ€™s exhibition Before We Blast Off: The Journey of Divine Forces. Mekoâ€™s visual efforts emanate a strong Southern vibe paying more homage to its urban subcultures than an affinity for rocking chairs. The Alabama-born artist manipulates iconography to embody a new meaning, often, like in this collection, taking on themes of perseverance. His fascination with the relationship between physical and psychological is palpable in his work that blends clear, straightforward images with amorphous scribbling and other shapes. In a way, it kinda makes perfect sense Meko funded his Atlanta move with winnings from a gambling match with a flagrant Alabaman gangster. Itâ€™s his mysterious familiarity that draws you in.

          The goofy staging takes on a self-described format akin to a BuzzFeed listicle which â€¦ is not a theatrical approach most of us could possibly find trite. Perry Frost, part of the Woodruff Arts Center family and Dadâ€™s Garageâ€™s youngest improviser, penned the piece. Longtime Dadâ€™s player Matt Horgan (who has writing credits for productions such as Song of the Living Dead: A Zombie Musical and Drove, among others, under his belt) directs. The play investigates some of the most catastrophic snafus in modern human history â€” but donâ€™t expect any heart-shaped gems or unsinkable ships; the website explicitly reads in a parenthetical aside: â€œNote: There will be NO Titanic. Too easy!â€ Points for creativity.

Directed by Justin Anderson and set in Washington, D.C., the politically fueled play spans six presidencies and more than 30 years, from the end of Carterâ€™s term to Obamaâ€™s inauguration. The off-Broadway performance follows Hester Ferris and her family, and things take a twist when Hesterâ€™s son brings home a Reagan-supporting girlfriend and a new conservative viewpoint.

          Kelly Cheats is a very active, touring band, performing in live music venues and festivals all over the Central and Southeastern states. The band formed in 2006 in Newberry, SC over a wild, unforgetable game of spades. They combineÂ elements of Rock, Southern Pop, Funk, Blues,Â and Reggae to form a new age, catchy,Â head-bouncing sound.Â  The soulful vocal harmonies created by lead singer Trent Dipner, femaleÂ vocalist Chelsea Warbington, trombone player Junior Eargle, and guitarist David George Sink along w funky, creative beats from drummer Â Eric Phillips, sets the group apart from most. The addition of Modern Disruption's Evans Mcteer on keys, Junior Eargle on trombone, David George Sink on guitar, and Eric Phillips has reallyÂ added to the strength and fullness of their sound. David's unmatched guitar play, along with bluesy harmonica licksÂ from Trent Dipner, has really helped to highlightÂ the bands ties and love of the blues and southern rock. Junior Eargle's sleek slide-trombone playÂ and Evans Mcteer's wizardry on keysÂ livens up the party every time they sound off. Eric Phillips's steadiness brings it all together and is the last link thatÂ connects this powerhouse of talent. Their first Album release,Â Out Of The PatchÂ 2010,Â Plaugh's House Recording Studio), featured a mix of all these genres. The group just finished up with their second release,Â Keep On SmilingÂ 2016,Â Plaugh's House Recording StudioÂ and is available for purchase now!!Â Kelly Cheats has been selected as a top semi-finalist in the Belk Southern Musician Showcase. The band has been featured on 92.1 The Palm's morning show, 105.7 the Source's live feature show,Â WXRY Unsigned's live feature show, Shutter 16 Magazine, Gigspotting, and has regular rotation play on many stations all over.

          The heart of the festival is the parade (Sat., June 4, 11 a.m.-3 p.m.), a 2- to 3-mile procession, where an elaborate and colorful chariot covered in everything from swans to fresh flowers is drawn along Peachtree by ropes a hundred feet long. Traditionally, the festival known to Hindus as Ratha yatra, is in celebration of Lord Krishna and his devotees and is known for its lively dancing, worshipping, and chanting. Today festivalgoers can expect live music from drummers and hand cymbalists in addition to dance performances showcasing the ancient art worship form of Odissi. If your feet get tired, break in the mantra meditation and yoga tents set up alongside the parade or adorn yourself with some first-class henna. Open to everyone regardless of religion background, organizers only ask that you bring your â€œselfless assistanceâ€ in making sure everyone has a good time.

          Stylistic shape-shifter, activist, and inimitable pop icon, Cyndi Lauper has been successfully reinventing herself for the better part of three decades. Expertly wielding her unmistakable voice, Lauper has conquered genre after genre, from pop to jazz to blues. For her latest studio album, Detour, Lauper has again reinvented herself, this time as a country-Western chanteuse. Featuring covers of country classics like L.E. Whiteâ€™s â€œYouâ€™re the Reason Our Kids are Uglyâ€ (made famous by Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty) and duets with the likes of Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson, Detour stands to become another classic in the Cyndi Lauper canon.

          Bas, born Abbas Hamad, is the first rapper signed to J Coleâ€™s Dreamville Records. The Queens-based rapper stands on the leading edge of a burgeoning East Coast hip-hop sound thatâ€™s built upon intensely personal narratives cut from equal parts introspection and real-life experience. Basâ€™ second proper album, Too High to Riot, is teeming with slow-burning atmospheric songs such as â€œMatchesâ€ (featuring the Hics), â€œMiles and Miles,â€ and â€œBlack Owned Businessâ€ â€” the kinds of post-basic hip-hop numbers materializing in a world still reeling from Kendrick Lamar showing young artists what hip-hop can be when the emphasis is placed on breaking the cliches of hip-hop production and songwriting.

          Local lens-based artist Cynthia Farnellâ€™s dual installation at Downtownâ€™s Gallery 72, Ancestors | Milk and Wine, examines cultural and personal memory through the relationship between objects, photographs, and projected images. Ancestors explores mythological and archetypal imagery while Milk and Wine focuses on Farnellâ€™s fatherâ€™s hobby of cultivating lilies in relation to memory, place, and identity. â€œThrough a methodology of autobiographical montage and non-linear narrative, Iâ€™m exploring ideas of self, community, place, and heritage in the contemporary urban Southeastern United States,â€ Farnell says. An opening reception takes place Thurs., April 14, at 6 p.m.
